# Database 2 SQLite

The goal of this project is to cache the view of a specific query for a database like MongoDB. This view in SQLite can 
then be used in a project like Apache SuperSet or similar to further query and visualize the data.

- [ ] Add support for more databases
- [ ] Break out each database into modules or classes
